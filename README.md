# WebApp Component UI

The **_Webapp UI components library_** aims to be a library of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components that can be used to customize/enhance our [Azure Sample Webapp](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/azure-sample-webapp).

You can use this project as a components library to build a front-end for your own Digital Twin solution.

Feel free to contribute to this library.
The more components we have, the easier your webapp customization will be.

Documentation for the components is available in the [doc](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/webapp-component-ui/doc) folder.

## Build project

`yarn install && yarn build` will package the project.

This command will allow you to use `yarn link` and `á»³arn link @cosmotech/ui` commands to deal with this project locally.
